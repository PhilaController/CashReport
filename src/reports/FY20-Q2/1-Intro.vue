      Note: This report describes the City’s cash balances and projections as of
      December 31, 2019, before the City of Philadelphia’s response to the
      COVID-19 pandemic. As such, the following analysis does not consider the
      potential impact of COVID-19 on the City’s tax revenues or spending for
      the rest of the fiscal year. The financial impact of COVID-19 will be
      discussed in detail in future cash reports.

      The City of Philadelphia (City) releases a summary of its current
      financial state, entitled the Quarterly City Manager’s Report (QCMR), 45
      days after the close of each fiscal quarter. As part of the QCMR, the City
      publishes actual and projected monthly cash balances for its major
      operating funds, as well as revenues and expenditures for its principal
      operating fund, the General Fund. The QCMR offers the most up-to-date
      snapshot of the current cash position of the City and the most accurate
      projection for cash balances at the close of the fiscal year. As part of
      our ongoing commitment to increasing transparency around the City’s
      financials, the Controller’s Office releases data on the City’s cash
      position in an interactive format following the release of each QCMR.

      This report summarizes the City’s cash position at the end of the second
      quarter of fiscal year 2020 (FY20 Q2). It is divided into two main
      sections. The first discusses the cash balances for the City’s major
      funds, and the second examines the revenues and expenditures associated
      with the General Fund. In both sections we present actual data from FY20
      Q2, as well as the projected data for the rest of the current fiscal year.
      All data used in this report is taken directly from the City’s QCMRs. The
      QCMR for FY20 Q2 can be found
