        With a Consolidated Cash balance of $1.25B and a General Fund balance of
        $774M, the City’s cash levels remained historically strong at the end of
        the second quarter of FY20.
      </li>
      <li>
        The City’s cash levels at the end of FY20 Q2 were also higher than
        anticipated. The Consolidated Cash account and the General Fund ended
        FY20 Q2 with balances $177M and $120M higher than projected after Q1 of
        this fiscal year.
      </li>
      <li>
        General Fund cash revenue in FY20 Q2 increased by 10.6 percent as
        compared to the second quarter of last fiscal year, while General Fund
        spending decreased by 1.1 percent relative to Q2 of last fiscal year.
      </li>
      <li>
        The General Fund’s cash spending annual total is projected to increase
        by 7.9 percent in FY20 relative to FY19, surpassing the $5B threshold
        for the first time in the City’s history. Despite the strong revenue
        growth in FY20 Q2, the City estimates that annual General Fund cash
        revenue will increase by only 2.3 percent relative to last fiscal year.
