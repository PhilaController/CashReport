          The City’s General Fund ended FY20 with a balance of $759M, down from
          a year-end balance of $966M in FY19. This is the first year-over-year
          decrease since FY15, and the largest single-year decline since the
          last recession in FY08.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Consolidated Cash account ended with its highest balance since
          FY07, due in part to a historically high Capital Fund balance and an
          influx of grant money as part of the federal response to the COVID-19
          pandemic.
        </li>
        <li>
          Total cash revenue for the General Fund declined by 4.6% relative to
          FY19. Major factors include a delay in the filing deadlines for the
          City’s business taxes as well as the economic shutdown in response to
          the ongoing pandemic, which led to year-over-year declines in all
          major tax revenue collections in FY20 Q4.
        </li>
        <li>
          Total cash spending for the General Fund increased by 4.0% in FY20
          relative to FY19. Payroll spending accounted for the largest increase,
          which increased by 36% in FY20 Q4 relative to FY19 Q4. Spending on
          contracts and materials/equipment increased 26% and 24%, respectively.
          Contributing factors include historically high overtime spending,
          temporary wage increases, retroactive labor contract extensions, and
          higher costs associated with the City’s response to the COVID-19
          pandemic.
