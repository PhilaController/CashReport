      The COVID-19 pandemic had a large and immediate effect on the City’s
      finances. Delays in filing deadlines for BIRT shifted more than $200M in
      collections from FY20 Q4 to the first quarter of FY21. The economic
      shutdown precipitated by the pandemic led to sharp declines in all major
      revenue collections, while the public health response required additional
      spending increases. The result was the largest year-over-year decrease in
      the City’s year-end General Fund balance since the Great Recession.
      However, the City entered FY20 with historic cash levels, and the year-end
      General Fund balance in FY20 was on par with the year-end balance for FY18
      and was still larger than any closing balance from FY07 to FY17. With the
      COVID-19 pandemic ongoing and the largest economic impacts expected in the
      next fiscal year, the City’s cash reserves will be more important than
      ever in weathering this unprecedented fiscal and public health crisis.
