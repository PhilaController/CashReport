      <li>
        Due to its historically strong General Fund cash balance, the City did
        not have to borrow any short-term funds, known as TRANs, during FY19 Q2.
        This is the first time the City has not done so during the second
        quarter of a fiscal year in more than ten years.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Consolidated Cash balance at the end of Q2 was $174M more than the
        City projected at the end of the first quarter of this fiscal year,
        driven by higher than anticipated balances for the Grants Fund (+$109M)
        and the General Fund (+$60M).
      </li>
      <li>
        General Fund cash revenues and expenditures both increased in FY19 Q2
        relative to the second quarter of last fiscal year, with increases of 9
        and 19 percent respectively. This revenue total was $36M higher than the
        City expected at the end of the last quarter, while the Q2 spending
        total was $23M less than the City’s Q1 estimate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Year-end projections for the City’s cash balances and total General Fund
        revenue/spending are consistent with those from last quarter. Annual
        General Fund cash receipts and expenditures are still expected to grow
        by about 4 and 12 percent, respectively, relative to last fiscal year.
