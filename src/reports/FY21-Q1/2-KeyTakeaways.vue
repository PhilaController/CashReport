        Due to the impact of the pandemic, the City borrowed $300M in short-term
        funds, known as a TRAN, during FY21 Q1. This is the first TRAN borrowing
        since FY18 and the largest borrowing since FY09 when the City borrowed
        $350M in the aftermath of the Great Recession.
      </li>
      <li>
        Boosted by the additional TRAN funds, the General Fund ended FY21 Q1 at
        a historic high with a balance of $1,282M. This balance, in addition to
        a large Grants Fund balance, contributed to the Consolidated Cash
        account ending FY21 Q1 with a balance of more than $2,000M.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cash spending decreased by $128M, or about 11 percent, in the first
        quarter of FY21 relative to last fiscal year. General Fund cash revenue
        increased by $154M (+15 percent) in FY21 Q1 relative to FY20 Q1 due
        primarily to the change in the filing date for the City’s Business
        Income and Receipts Tax to July 2020.
      </li>
      <li>
        The General Fund is projected to end FY21 with a total balance of $598M,
        the lowest fund balance since FY17, when the General Fund ended the
        fiscal year with a balance of $534M. This closing fund balance is still
        significantly higher than the balances maintained during the Great
        Recession, the lowest of which was −$30.6M at the end of FY10.
