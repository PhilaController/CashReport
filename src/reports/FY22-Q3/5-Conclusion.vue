    <p>
      With the use of $250M in ARP funds and better-than-expected tax revenue
      collections through three quarters of this fiscal year, the City is
      projecting an increase to the end-of-year General Fund cash balance, with
      total cash revenue expected to exceed total cash spending by about $100M.
      The City anticipates the General Fund will end FY22 with a cash balance of
      more than $1B, which would be the highest end-of-year cash balance ever.
      This historic cash balance would occur despite a projected 13% annual
      increase in cash spending, which would be the largest spending increase in
      recent history.

      While the pandemic’s impact on the local economy continues, economic
      activity and some tax revenue collections, particularly the City’s Realty
      Transfer Tax, have rebounded so far in FY22. The City is set to receive
      the second half of its $1.4B allocation from the ARP during the fourth
      quarter of FY22. With only $250M of its ARP funds spent so far, the City
      will need to spend the remaining $1.2B by the end of calendar year 2025.
      This spending will need to be done carefully to avoid creating
      unsustainable spending levels once the federal funds run out. In future
      cash reports, the Controller’s Office will continue to monitor the City’s
      cash position, including the impact of the federal relief on the City’s
      finances.
