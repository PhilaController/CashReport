      <li>
        A combination of better-than-expected tax revenue collections and
        federal funding received as part of the American Rescue Plan (ARP) have
        helped to keep the City’s cash balances at historic highs.
      </li>
      <li>
        In FY22 Q3, cash revenue for the General Fund increased by 34% (+$486M),
        boosted by the City’s use of $250M of its $1.4B in ARP funds. This is
        the first portion of ARP funding used by the City, and it helped offset
        a 7.1% (+$106M) increase in cash spending in FY22 Q3 relative to FY21
        Q3.
      </li>
      <li>
        The City revised its annual revenue collection totals upwards for the
        Realty Transfer Tax (+$176M) and the Business Income and Receipts Tax
        (+$83M). Cash revenue is now expected to grow 10% in FY22, while cash
        spending is projected to increase 13%. This would be the largest annual
        spending increase since at least FY07.
      </li>
      <li>
        The City revised its end-of-year General Fund cash balance upwards by
        $192M and is now projecting the highest end-of-year cash balance of all
        time for the General Fund ($1.1B).
