      Sufficient cash levels are essential for performing the day-to-day
      operations of a city government. A city’s cash, primarily generated from
      taxes and fees, is used to pay its employees, vendors, and other
      obligations, such as debt. Cash levels also provide a measure of a city’s
      ability to pay off short-term obligations, an important indicator of a
      city’s financial strength. As part of our commitment to transparency, the
      Controller’s Office will release information on Philadelphia’s cash
      position each quarter so that taxpayers – residents and businesses – have
      a fuller picture of the City of Philadelphia’s (City) financial health.
    </p>
    <p>
      The City groups its finances into several different funds to better
      facilitate control over resources dedicated for specific purposes. For its
      day-to-day operations, the City pools together the cash balances
      associated with several funds into a single account, known as the
      Consolidated Cash account. Three major funds, listed below, and several
      smaller funds, including the Housing Trust and Hospital Assessment Funds,
      contribute to the Consolidated Cash account:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        the General Fund, which is the principal operating fund of the City.
        About three-quarters of the revenue flowing into the General Fund is
        generated from local taxes;
      </li>
      <li>
        the Grants Fund, which manages grants received from state, federal, and
        private agencies. The Department of Human Services, which provides child
        welfare services, comprises about 40% of the Grants Fund’s spending
        obligations, with the majority of this spending reimbursed through state
        funding; and
      </li>
      <li>
        the Capital Fund, which manages resources for investing in facilities
        and infrastructure throughout the city. The majority of its revenue
        arises from bond proceeds.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The City is legally restricted from utilizing several other funds for its
      daily operations. These include the Behavioral Health Fund, which handles
      state funding for behavioral health care services, and the Water and
      Aviation Funds, which generate self-sustaining revenue through user fees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout each fiscal year, the City releases a summary of its current
      financial state, entitled the
      <a
        href="https://www.phila.gov/finance/reports-Quarterly.html"
        target="_blank"
        >Quarterly City Manager’s Report</a
      >
      (QCMR). The report provides an update on the City’s financial status
      compared with the budget outlined prior to the start of each fiscal year.
      As part of the QCMR, the City publishes actual and projected monthly cash
      balances for its major operating funds, as well as revenues and
      expenditures for its principal operating fund, the General Fund. The QCMR
      offers the most up-to-date snapshot of the current cash position of the
      City and the most accurate projection for cash balances at the close of
      the fiscal year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within 45-days of the close of each fiscal quarter, the City releases the
      QCMR. Following its release, the Controller’s Office will, in the spirit
      of financial transparency, use the information presented in the QCMR to
      publish a Cash Report. Each Cash Report will present updated cash balances
      in an interactive format, along with an analysis of prominent trends. The
      Cash Report for the fourth quarter of each fiscal year will follow a
      different format, focusing on the City’s cash position for the fiscal year
      as compared to historical data. Again, the Cash Report will present data
      pulled directly from the City’s QCMR.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following report, the first installment in the Cash Report series,
      focuses on the City’s cash position at the end of the fourth quarter of
      fiscal year 2018 (FY18), as of June 30, 2018. It considers the cash
      balances for the entirety of FY18 as compared with historical data dating
      back to fiscal year 2007.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">[1]</a></sup>

    <p>
      Rating agencies, such as
      <a href="https://www.standardandpoors.com" target="_blank"
        >Standard & Poor’s</a
      >
      (S&P), set guidelines for what is deemed an adequate, good, and strong
      level of reserves for municipalities. S&P considers fund balance levels
      that are 8% to 15% of annual expenditures to be strong, while 4% to 8% is
      considered good. The
      <a

        target="_blank"
        >Government Finance Officers Association</a
      >
      recommends governments, regardless of size, maintain a fund balance of no
      less than two months of General Fund expenditures, corresponding to about
      17% of annual expenditures. These recommendations can be used as a measure
      of how much cash a city should have in reserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, it is important to note that these guidelines are set for an
      unrestricted fund balance reported on a
      <a
        href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/modified-accrual-accounting.asp"
        target="_blank"
        >modified accrual basis</a
      >, which accounts for future, but known, revenues and expenditures. Fund
      balances on a modified accrual basis are typically lower than balances on
      a cash basis. For example, in fiscal year 2017 the City’s General Fund
      balance on a modified accrual basis was $189 million, or 4.6% of
      expenditures. On a cash basis, the General Fund balance was $534 million,
      or 13.1% of expenditures. For consistency, this report focuses on cash
      levels as detailed in the QCMR.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">[2]</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      Historically, the City has struggled to meet recommendations for fund
      balance levels. However, FY18 was a good year for the City’s cash. The
      City saw substantial gains to its cash balances. It marks the first time
      in more than a decade that the General, Grants, and Capital Funds each
      experienced increases in their end-of-fiscal year cash balances. The
      result is a historically strong cash position with a General Fund cash
      balance of $769 million and a Consolidated Cash balance of $993 million.
      The General Fund cash balance of $769 million represents 18%, or a little
      over two months-worth, of annual cash expenditures.
