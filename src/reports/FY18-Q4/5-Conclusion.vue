      The fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 ended a historically notable year
      for the City’s cash balances. The balance of the Consolidated Cash account
      more than doubled in FY18, ending with a total of $993 million. This large
      cash increase was driven by balance increases for each of the General,
      Capital, and Grants Funds - the first time this has occurred in the last
      ten years. A surplus of $235 million in cash receipts over expenditures
      led to a fiscal year-end cash balance of $769 million for the General
      Fund, the highest of the past decade. The General Fund cash position has
      shown remarkable improvement since its low point following the Great
      Recession when it ended fiscal year 2010 with a deficit of $31 million.

      The City’s cash position is an important measure of its financial health.
      Cash enables the City to perform the daily operations of a local
      government and pay its short-term obligations. In its recovery from the
      Great Recession, Philadelphia has struggled to meet fund balance
      recommendations for local governments.<sup

      However, FY18 brought a significant increase to the City’s cash position,
      and the closing General Fund balance of $769 million represents 18% of its
      annual cash expenditures in FY18.
