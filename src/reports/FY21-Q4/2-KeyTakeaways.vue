        The City’s cash position remained strong at the end of FY21, with the
        General Fund ending the year with its highest cash balance since at
        least FY07. Due primarily to higher-than-expected revenue and
        lower-than-expected spending, the actual end-of-year cash balance for
        the General Fund was $476M higher than the projection from the adopted
        FY21 budget in June 2020.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Grants Fund ended FY21 with a cash balance of $950M, its highest
        since at least FY07. The balance was boosted by the City receiving the
        first half of its $1.4B in federal relief as part of the American Rescue
        Plan.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Consolidated Cash account, the City’s combined cash fund, ended FY21
        with a balance of more than $2.2B, its highest since at least FY07, as a
        result of the historically high cash balances for the General Fund and
        Grants Fund.
      </li>
      <li>
        Due to budget cuts enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, total
        cash spending declined by 3% in FY21. Total cash revenue for the General
        Fund increased by 6.2% relative to FY20. Primarily, this increase is a
        result of the City delaying the filing deadline for business taxes in
        FY20 to FY21, which lead to additional payments of these taxes during
        FY21.
