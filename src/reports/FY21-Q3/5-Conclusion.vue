    <p>
      As the City continues to address the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic,
      cash spending for the General Fund is projected to outpace cash revenues
      by $95M in FY21. Consequently, the cash balance for the General Fund is
      projected to decline, ending the fiscal year with a balance of $663.8M.
      This would be the lowest year-end fund balance since FY18 and more than
      $300M lower than the pre-pandemic year-end balance in FY19 ($966M), a sign
      of the substantial impact the pandemic has had on the City’s finances
      since April 2020. However, the General Fund balance is still significantly
      higher than the historic lows of the Great Recession, during which the
      end-of-year fund balance reached a low of −$30.6M in FY10.

      With most of the City’s public health restrictions coming to an end in
      June 2021, economic activity and tax revenue collections are not expected
      to return to pre-pandemic levels until sometime during FY22 at the
      earliest. However, the City will receive a total of $1.4B in federal aid
      from the American Rescue Plan, which will allow the City to fill revenue
      shortfalls caused by the pandemic and restore services and cuts to
      departmental spending. Previously, the Controller’s Office released a
      <a

        target="_blank"
        >report</a
      >
      with recommendations on how to best spend this unprecedented influx of
      federal funding. In future cash reports, the office will continue to
      monitor the City’s cash position, including the impact of the federal
      relief on the City’s finances.
