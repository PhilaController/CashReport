      <li>
        Boosted by $300M in short-term borrowing during FY21 Q1 and grant
        funding received from the federal government to support COVID-19
        pandemic response efforts, the Cityâ€™s cash balances remained
        historically high.
      </li>
      <li>
        In FY21 Q3, cash spending for the General Fund decreased by $20.9M, or
        about 1.4 percent, relative to the third quarter of last fiscal year.
        General Fund cash revenue experienced a larger decline due to the
        ongoing economic effects of the pandemic, decreasing by $105.8M (-6.9
        percent) in FY21 Q3 relative to FY20 Q3.
      </li>
      <li>
        The projection for the end-of-year General Fund cash balance increased
        by $158.6M due to a combination of lower expected spending (-$138.6M)
        and increased revenues (+$20.1M). Despite the projected increase, the
        projected cash balance of $663.8M would still be the lowest year-end
        fund balance since FY18.
      </li>
      <li>
        The City will receive the first half of its $1.4B in federal relief from
        the American Rescue Plan during Q4 of FY21. To incorporate these funds,
        the City revised the end-of-year balance for the Grants Fund upwards by
        $688M relative to previous projections.
