      The City of Philadelphia (City) releases a summary of its current
      financial state, entitled the Quarterly City Manager’s Report (QCMR), 45
      days after the close of each fiscal quarter. As part of the QCMR, the
      City’s Budget Office publishes actual and projected monthly cash balances
      for its major operating funds, as well as revenues and expenditures for
      its principal operating fund, the General Fund. The QCMR offers the most
      up-to-date snapshot of the current cash position of the City and the most
      accurate projection for cash balances at the close of the fiscal year. As
      part of our ongoing commitment to increasing transparency around the
      City’s finances, the Controller’s Office releases data on the City’s cash
      position in an interactive format following the release of each QCMR.

      This report summarizes the City’s cash position at the end of the third
      quarter of fiscal year 2021 (FY21 Q3), and it reflects the ongoing impacts
      of the COVID-19 pandemic on the City’s finances. During the months covered
      in this report (January through March of calendar year 2021), the City had
      not yet lifted many of the public health restrictions that were
      implemented over the course of the pandemic. Though the public health
      situation in Philadelphia has improved with the availability of COVID-19
      vaccines, the pandemic continues to impact the city’s economy, with
      unemployment remaining above pre-COVID levels. As the City’s economy
      recovers, the Controller’s Office will continue to monitor the City’s
      finances in future cash reports.

      The report is divided into two main sections. The first discusses the cash
      balances for the City’s major funds, and the second examines the revenues
      and expenditures associated with the General Fund. In both sections we
      present actual data for FY21 Q3. All data used in this report is taken
      directly from the City’s QCMRs. The QCMR for FY21 Q3 can be found
