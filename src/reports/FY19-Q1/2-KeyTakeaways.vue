        The City’s cash levels, which began FY19 at a 10-year high, continued at
        historic levels through the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2019. The
        General Fund and Consolidated Cash ended FY19 Q1 with balances of $747M
        and $1.01B, respectively — both are the highest Q1 balances of the last
        decade.
      </li>
      <li>
        Due to planned increases in spending, the cash balances for the General
        Fund and Consolidated Cash are estimated to be lower at the end of FY19
        than the FY18 year-end totals.
      </li>
      <li>
        General Fund revenues in FY19 Q1 showed strong growth, totaling $42M
        more than in Q1 of last year. The growth is expected to continue, with
        annual revenue estimated to rise by about 4 percent in FY19.
      </li>
      <li>
        Annual General Fund expenditures are projected to be $517M more in FY19
        than in FY18, an increase of about 12 percent. In the last two fiscal
        years, this Q1 projection has been overestimated by an average of $146M.
