      The City of Philadelphia (City) releases a summary of its current
      financial state, entitled the Quarterly City Manager’s Report (QCMR),
      forty-five days after the close of each fiscal quarter. As part of the
      QCMR, the City publishes up-to-date snapshots of the current cash position
      of the City and estimates for cash balances at the close of the fiscal
      year. As part of our on-going commitment to increasing transparency around
      the City’s financials, the Controller’s Office releases data on the City’s
      cash position in an interactive format following the release of each QCMR.

      issued by the Controller’s Office at the end of Fiscal Year 2018. At that
      time, the City’s cash position was at a 10-year high, with a year-end cash
      balance of $769M for the General Fund and $993M for the Consolidated Cash
      account. This Cash Report presents the City’s cash position following the
      close of the first quarter (Q1) of Fiscal Year 2019 (FY19). It reflects
      actual revenue and expenditure totals from the first three months of the
      fiscal year: July, August, and September. As such, the cash balances and
      totals for the remaining months are projections that are subject to
      change. As the year progresses and the City’s economic and fiscal outlook
      becomes clearer, these monthly projections generally grow more accurate.

      This report is divided into two main sections. The first discusses the
      cash balances for the City’s major funds, and the second examines the
      revenues and expenditures associated with the General Fund. In both
      sections we present actual data from FY19 Q1, as well as the projected
      data for the rest of the current fiscal year. We also compare values for
      this fiscal year to the corresponding values from last fiscal year and use
      historical data to assess the accuracy of the City’s projections. All data
      used in this report is taken directly from the City’s QCMRs. The latest
      QCMR for the period ending September 30, 2018 is available on the City’s
