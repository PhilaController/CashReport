      The cash balances of the General Fund and Consolidated Cash at the end of
      the first quarter of FY19 are the largest Q1 balances of the last ten
      years. Despite these historically high balances, cash balances at the
      close of FY19 are projected to be lower than the FY18 year-end totals.
      This is due in large part to the estimated 12 percent growth in General
      Fund spending in FY19 relative to FY18. This added General Fund spending
      is one of the largest single-year increases of the last ten years and is
      worth monitoring closely in future Cash Reports as the fiscal year
      progresses.

      Q1 projections for the end of the fiscal year are uncertain and subject to
      change. Given this uncertainty, year-end estimates should generally be
      conservative in nature. This has historically been the case for the Q1
      estimates for the year-end cash balances of the General Fund and
      Consolidated Cash, which have underestimated actual year-end balances by
      about $130M, on average, since 2010. In a departure from historical
      trends, actual General Fund cash spending has been lower than the Q1
      projections by about $146M in the past two fiscal years. From Fiscal Years
      2009 to 2017, Q1 projections were more aligned with actual spending
      totals, with a difference of only $27M, on average.
