        The General Fund and Consolidated Cash ended FY20 Q1 with balances of
        $896M and $1,506M, respectively — both are the highest Q1 balances since
        2007. The large Consolidated Cash balance is due in part to a recent
        debt borrowing for the Capital Fund totaling close to $300M. With these
        additional bond proceeds, the Capital Fund ended FY20 Q1 with its
        highest balance in more than a decade, $436M.
      </li>
      <li>
        The City’s cash levels following FY20 Q1 are substantially higher than
        the projections from the City’s Five Year Plan, adopted by City Council
        in June 2019. The Five Year Plan projections, which tend to be
        conservative in nature, underestimated the actual end-of-Q1 General Fund
        cash balance by $343M and the actual Consolidated Cash balance by $515M.
      </li>
      <li>
        Total cash receipts for the General Fund increased by only $4M during
        FY20 Q1 versus the same period last fiscal year. Total cash spending for
        the General Fund increased by $53M in FY20 Q1, about a 5.0 percent
        increase relative to FY19 Q1.
      </li>
      <li>
        Annual General Fund cash receipts are projected to increase by about
        $63M in FY20, or 1.3 percent, relative to last fiscal year.
      </li>
      <li>
        Annual General Fund expenditures are projected to be $376M more in FY20
        than in FY19, an increase of 8.1 percent. However, annual spending
        projections in Q1 have been overestimated by an average of $143M for the
        last three fiscal years.
