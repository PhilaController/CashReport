    <p>
      The Cityâ€™s cash position at the end of FY20 Q1 has continued at historic
      levels. The FY20 Q1 cash balances for the General Fund, Capital Fund, and
      Consolidated Cash were the largest Q1 balances since 2007. This continues
      an upwards trend in the last three fiscal years that has seen the
      Consolidated Cash balance increase by more than $1B and the General Fund
      cash balance increase by more than $500M.
    </p>
    <p>
      The end-of-FY20 balance for the General Fund is currently projected to be
      lower than the FY19 year-end total, due in large part to the projected 8.1
      percent growth in cash spending. This added General Fund spending is the
      second largest of the last ten years, following only the 9 percent
      spending increase from FY19. With only modest (about 1 percent) revenue
      growth projected for FY20, such a large single-year spending increase is
      worth monitoring closely in future Cash Reports as the fiscal year
      progresses.
