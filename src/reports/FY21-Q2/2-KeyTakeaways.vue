        The City’s cash balances remained historically high at the end of FY21
        Q2, boosted by $300M in short-term borrowing, as well as grant funding
        received as part of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

        In FY21 Q2, cash spending for the General Fund increased by $62.7M, or
        about 5.6 percent, relative to the second quarter of last fiscal year.
        General Fund cash revenue decreased by $107M (−10.7 percent) in FY21 Q2
        relative to FY20 Q2, reflecting the economic impact of the COVID-19
        pandemic on the City’s finances.

        The City revised down its annual FY21 totals for nearly all major taxes,
        lowering its annual cash revenue projection for the General Fund by
        $49.9M. On the other hand, the City increased its expected cash spending
        in FY21 by $43.2M. With these changes, the City is projecting a year-end
        General Fund balance of $505M, a net decrease of $93.2M from the first
        quarter projection.
