    <p>
      As the City continues to address the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic,
      cash spending for the General Fund is projected to outpace cash revenues
      by $254M in FY21. Consequently, the cash balance for the General Fund is
      projected to decline, ending the fiscal year with a balance of $505M. This
      would be the lowest year-end fund balance since FY16 and substantially
      lower than the pre-pandemic year-end balance in FY19 ($966M), a sign of
      the substantial impact the pandemic has had on the City’s finances since
      April 2020. However, the General Fund balance is still significantly
      higher than the historic lows of the Great Recession, during which the
      end-of-year fund balance reached a low of −$30.6M in FY10.

      With the City’s public restrictions expected to remain in place through
      the end of FY21, economic activity and tax revenue collections are not
      expected to return to pre-pandemic levels until sometime during FY22 at
      the earliest. However, the City is expected to receive about $1.4 billion
      in federal aid as part of the recently passed American Rescue Plan Act,
      which will offset the pandemic’s impact

      the City’s cash position, including this influx of federal funding, as the
      city continues its economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.
