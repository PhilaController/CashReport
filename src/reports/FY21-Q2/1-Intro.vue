      The City of Philadelphia (City) releases a summary of its current
      financial state, entitled the Quarterly City Manager’s Report (QCMR), 45
      days after the close of each fiscal quarter. As part of the QCMR, the City
      publishes actual and projected monthly cash balances for its major
      operating funds, as well as revenues and expenditures for its principal
      operating fund, the General Fund. The QCMR offers the most up-to-date
      snapshot of the current cash position of the City and the most accurate
      projection for cash balances at the close of the fiscal year. As part of
      our ongoing commitment to increasing transparency around the City’s
      financials, the Controller’s Office releases data on the City’s cash
      position in an interactive format following the release of each QCMR.

      This report summarizes the City’s cash position at the end of the first
      quarter of fiscal year 2021 (FY21 Q1), and it reflects the ongoing impacts
      of the COVID-19 pandemic on the City’s finances. While the ultimate impact
      of the pandemic remains unknown, unemployment remains well above pre-COVID
      levels and many public health restrictions remain in place. As the City’s
      economy begins its recovery, the Controller’s Office will continue to
      monitor the City’s finances in future cash reports.

      The report is divided into two main sections. The first discusses the cash
      balances for the City’s major funds, and the second examines the revenues
      and expenditures associated with the General Fund. In both sections we
      present actual data for FY21 Q1. All data used in this report is taken
      directly from the City’s QCMRs. The QCMR for FY21 Q1 can be found
