      <li>
        Boosted by federal American Rescue Plan funds, the Grants Fund ended
        FY22 Q1 at a historic high with a balance of $882M. This balance, in
        addition to an increase in the Capital Fund balance, contributed to the
        Consolidated Cash account ending FY22 Q1 with a balance of more than
        $2,200M.
      </li>
      <li>
        General Fund cash revenue was substantially less in FY22 Q1 compared to
        FY21 Q1 as a result of the delay in the BIRT collection date during last
        fiscal year due to the pandemic. This one-time change resulted in $263M
        less in BIRT receipts collected during Q1 of this fiscal year. However,
        several other taxes showed signs of recovery, and the overall decline in
        revenue receipts was only $194M (-16 percent) in FY22 Q1 relative to
        FY21 Q1.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cash spending for the General Fund totaled $1,200M in FY22 Q1, a $91M
        (+8 percent) increase relative to the same quarter in FY21. The City
        projects annual FY22 cash spending to exceed all prior years, with
        anticipated General Fund expenditures totaling $5,265M.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Consolidated Cash fund is projected to end the fiscal year with a
        historically high balance of $2,431M. The City anticipates an
        unprecedented year-end balance of $1,149M for the Grants Fund, while the
        General Fund balance is expected to decline by $183M from FY21.
