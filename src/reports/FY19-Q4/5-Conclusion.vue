      The City began FY19 with cash balances at a historic level and ended the
      year with balances even higher. The Consolidated Cash account ended the
      fiscal year with a balance $1,085.9M, breaking the $1B threshold at the
      end of a fiscal year for the first time since 2007. Despite expenditures
      increasing by 9% in FY19, a surplus of $200M in revenue receipts led to an
      end-of-year balance of $966.4M for the General Fund. Driven by
      Philadelphia’s ongoing economic expansion, revenue receipts continued to
      grow in FY19, increasing by 7.7% relative to last fiscal year.

      The City’s cash position is an important measure of its financial health.
      Cash enables the City to perform the daily operations of a local
      government and pay its short-term obligations. In its recovery since the
      Great Recession, Philadelphia has struggled to meet fund balance
      recommendations for local governments. However, the City’s cash balances
      reached historic levels last fiscal year, and they have remained
      historically strong at the end of FY19. With a closing General Fund
      balance of $966.4M, the City’s General Fund cash level represented 21% of
      its annual cash expenditures in FY19.
