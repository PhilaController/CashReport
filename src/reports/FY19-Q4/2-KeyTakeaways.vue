          The City’s General Fund and the Consolidated Cash account ended FY19
          with the highest cash balances since FY07.
        </li>
        <li>
          The end-of-year General Fund balance was $966.4M, which represents 21%
          of the City’s annual General Fund cash expenditures in FY19.
        </li>
        <li>
          Due to its historically strong cash position, the City did not need to
          borrow any short-term funds during FY19 for the first time in more
          than ten years.
        </li>
        <li>
          Total cash revenues and expenditures for the General Fund increased
          substantially relative to last fiscal year, with revenue growing by
          7.7% and spending growing by 9.0%.
        </li>
        <li>
          A surplus of cash revenue receipts over expenditures resulted in the
          General Fund’s closing cash balance increasing by about $200M in FY19
          relative to its balance at the end of last fiscal year.
