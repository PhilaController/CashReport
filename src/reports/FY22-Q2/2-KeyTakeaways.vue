      <li>
        Boosted by federal American Rescue Plan funds, the Grants Fund ended
        FY22 Q2 at a historic high with a balance of $788M. This balance, in
        addition to an increase in the Capital Fund balance, contributed to the
        Consolidated Cash account ending FY22 Q2 with a balance of $2,000M.
      </li>
      <li>
        General Fund cash revenue totaled $987M in FY22 Q2, an $89M (+10
        percent) increase over FY21 Q2. This increase is largely attributable to
        increased collections for the Cityâ€™s Wage Tax and Business Income
        Receipts Tax (BIRT), rather than American Rescue Plan (ARP) funds. The
        City has not yet transferred ARP funds from the Grants Fund to the
        General Fund since receiving these funds in FY21 Q4.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cash spending for the General Fund totaled $1,115M in FY22 Q2, a $76M
        (-6 percent) decrease relative to the same quarter in FY21. The City
        projects annual FY22 cash spending to exceed all prior years, with
        anticipated General Fund expenditures totaling $5,239M.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Consolidated Cash fund is projected to end the fiscal year with a
        historically high balance of $2,577M, while the General Fund balance is
        expected to decline by $93M from FY21. The City is set to receive the
        remaining $700M from the American Rescue Plan in May 2022 and is
        projecting a year-end Grants Fund balance of $1,199M.
