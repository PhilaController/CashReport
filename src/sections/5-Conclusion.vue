        At the close of the first full fiscal year following the COVID-19
        pandemic, the City’s cash position remained strong. While the pandemic
        has certainly impacted City finances, resulting in revenue declines and
        spending cuts, the impact was not as large as originally anticipated in
        June 2020. The City managed to end FY21 with its highest cash balance
        for the General Fund since at least FY07, $15M higher than the
        pre-pandemic level from FY19. With the passage of the American Rescue
        Plan, the City also received the first half of its $1.4B in federal
        relief, bringing the Grants Fund balance to an unprecedented $950M at
        the end of FY21. Altogether, this resulted in the City closing FY21 with
        a Consolidated Cash balance of more than $2.2B, its highest since at
        least FY07.

        While economic activity has increased from its low point in summer 2020,
        the City and Commonwealth have recently re-implemented a number of
        public health restrictions. As the city continues its recovery from the
        pandemic, unemployment remains high and collections for the majority of
        taxes are still below pre-pandemic baselines. In the coming fiscal year,
        the City can use funds from the American Rescue Plan to fill any
        additional revenue shortfalls caused by the pandemic and restore
        services and cuts to departmental spending. Previously, the Controller’s
        Office released a
        <a

          >report</a
        >
        with recommendations on how to best spend this unprecedented influx of
        federal funding. In future cash reports, the office will continue to
        monitor the City’s cash position, including the impact of the federal
        relief on the City’s finances.
